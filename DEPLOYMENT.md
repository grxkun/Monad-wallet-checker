# üõ°Ô∏è Monad Security Monitor - Public Deployment Guide

A comprehensive security monitoring system for detecting and preventing EIP-7702 delegation attacks on Monad testnet.

## üéØ Purpose

This tool was born from a real attack investigation where a user's wallet was compromised via a sophisticated EIP-7702 delegation attack through mac-chi.vercel.app (NFT verification scam). The attacker successfully stole 4,126 MON tokens by tricking users into authorizing delegations to malicious contracts.

**Our mission**: Protect the entire Monad community by providing real-time threat detection and intelligence sharing.

## üöÄ Quick Deploy to Production

### Option 1: Lovable + Supabase (Recommended)

#### Frontend Deployment (Lovable)

1. **Clone Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/monad-security/wallet-monitor.git
   cd wallet-monitor
   ```

2. **Set up Lovable Project**
   - Go to [Lovable.dev](https://lovable.dev)
   - Create new project: "Monad Security Monitor"
   - Upload the `/src/frontend/SecurityMonitor.tsx` component
   - Configure environment variables:
     ```
     REACT_APP_API_URL=https://your-backend-url.herokuapp.com
     ```

3. **Deploy Frontend**
   - Deploy with Lovable's one-click deployment
   - Your frontend will be available at: `https://monad-security-monitor.lovable.app`

#### Backend Deployment (Supabase + Heroku)

1. **Set up Supabase Database**
   - Create account at [Supabase.com](https://supabase.com)
   - Create new project: "monad-security-db"
   - Run the SQL schema from `supabase-schema.sql` in the SQL editor
   - Copy your Project URL and anon key

2. **Deploy Backend to Heroku**
   ```bash
   # Install Heroku CLI and login
   heroku create monad-security-api
   
   # Set environment variables
   heroku config:set NODE_ENV=production
   heroku config:set SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
   heroku config:set SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key

## üìä API Endpoints

### Public API (No Authentication Required)

```bash
# Health check
GET /api/health

# Scan any wallet
POST /api/scan-wallet
{
  "address": "0x..."
}

# Get recent threats
GET /api/threats

# Report suspicious activity
POST /api/report-threat
{
  "address": "0x...",

### WebSocket Real-time Monitoring

```javascript
const ws = new WebSocket('wss://monad-security-api.herokuapp.com');
ws.onmessage = (event) => {
  const alert = JSON.parse(event.data);
  if (alert.type === 'threat_alert') {
    // Display real-time threat alert
    console.log('New threat detected:', alert.alert);

```bash
# Test with the known compromised wallet
curl -X POST https://monad-security-api.herokuapp.com/api/scan-wallet \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"address": "0x1234..."}'

# Should return critical risk level with delegation detected
```

### Test Real-time Monitoring

- **Community Reports**: Use the built-in reporting system for new threats
- **Security Disclosures**: Contact team for responsible disclosure

## üéØ Success Metrics

### Protection Goals
- **Zero Future Victims**: Prevent mac-chi.vercel.app style attacks
- **Community Coverage**: Monitor 1000+ wallets daily
- **Response Time**: Detect new threats within 1 block confirmation
- **Intelligence Sharing**: Build comprehensive threat database

### Key Performance Indicators
- **Threat Detection Rate**: % of attacks caught in real-time
- **False Positive Rate**: Maintain <5% false alarms
- **Community Engagement**: Active users and reports
- **Prevention Success**: Wallets protected from delegation attacks

## üÜò Emergency Response

If you discover a new attack:

1. **Immediate**: Report via `/api/report-threat` endpoint
2. **Evidence**: Include transaction hashes and attack vectors  
3. **Communication**: Alert is broadcast to all connected users
4. **Update**: Malicious contracts are added to permanent database

**Remember**: This system exists because individual users can't remember every attack vector. Together, we build community immunity against sophisticated attacks like the mac-chi.vercel.app delegation scam.
