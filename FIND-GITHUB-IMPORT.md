- **Recommended**: Choose "Sign in with GitHub" for seamless integration

### **Step 3: Find "Import from GitHub" Button**

After signing in, you'll see the main dashboard. Look for:

#### **Option A: New Project Button**
1. Look for a **"New Project"** or **"Create Project"** button
2. Click it
3. You'll see options including **"Import from GitHub"**

2. It might be labeled as:
   - "Import from GitHub"
   - "Connect GitHub"
   - "Import Repository"
   - "From GitHub"

### **Step 4: Alternative Navigation Paths**

If you don't see it immediately, try:

#### **Dashboard Menu:**
- Look for a **"+"** plus icon
- Look for **"Projects"** in the navigation menu
- Look for **"Import"** in the main menu

#### **Getting Started Section:**
- New users often see a "Getting Started" section
- This usually has an "Import from GitHub" option

## üñºÔ∏è **What to Look For (Visual Cues)**

### **GitHub Icon + Text:**
```
[GitHub Icon] Import from GitHub
```

### **Common Button Styles:**
- Blue button with GitHub logo
- "Connect GitHub Repository" 
- "Import existing project"
- "From Git repository"

## üîÑ **If You Can't Find It**

### **Alternative Method 1: Direct URL**
Try going directly to: `https://lovable.dev/new` or `https://lovable.dev/import`

### **Alternative Method 2: GitHub Integration**
1. Go to your GitHub repository: `https://github.com/grxkun/Monad-wallet-checker`
2. Look for "Deploy" buttons or integrations
3. Some platforms have direct deployment buttons on GitHub

### **Alternative Method 3: Contact Support**
- Look for "Help" or "Support" on Lovable
- Many platforms have chat support to guide you

## üì± **Mobile vs Desktop**

### **Desktop Version:**
- Usually more prominent buttons
- Sidebar navigation might have "Import" option

### **Mobile Version:**
- Might be in a hamburger menu (‚â°)
- Could be under "Projects" or "+" icon

## üéØ **What Happens After You Find It**

Once you click "Import from GitHub":

1. **Authorize Lovable** to access your GitHub (if not done already)
2. **Select Repository**: Choose `grxkun/Monad-wallet-checker`
3. **Set Root Directory**: Enter `lovable-frontend/`
4. **Configure Project**: Lovable auto-detects React + Vite
5. **Add Environment Variables**: Set `VITE_API_URL`
6. **Deploy**: Click the deploy button

## üÜò **Still Can't Find It?**

### **Platform-Specific Notes:**
Different deployment platforms have different interfaces:

#### **If you're on Lovable.dev:**
- Should have GitHub import prominently displayed
- Often in the main dashboard after sign-in

#### **If you're on a different platform:**
Let me know which platform you're actually using, and I can provide specific instructions!

### **Screenshot Request:**
If you can describe what you see on your screen after signing in to Lovable, I can help you navigate from there.

## üöÄ **Quick Alternative: Try These Platforms**

If Lovable isn't working as expected, these platforms also support React deployment:

1. **Vercel**: [vercel.com](https://vercel.com) - Very clear "Import Git Repository" button
2. **Netlify**: [netlify.com](https://netlify.com) - "Import from Git" button
3. **Render**: [render.com](https://render.com) - "Connect repository" option

---

**üí° Tip**: Most modern deployment platforms have GitHub integration as their primary feature, so the "Import from GitHub" option should be very prominent on the main dashboard after signing in.
