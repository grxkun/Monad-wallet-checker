# 🎉 FULL-STACK INTEGRATION COMPLETE!

## ✅ Backend Connected Successfully

Your Lovable frontend is now directly connected to your Railway backend!

### What Was Done:
1. **Updated Frontend Code:** Modified `lovable-frontend/src/App.tsx` to use Railway URL directly
2. **No Environment Variables Needed:** Since it's a public API endpoint, added as constant in code
3. **Pushed to GitHub:** Changes will auto-deploy to Lovable from your connected repository

### Live URLs:
- **Frontend:** https://mondoctor.lovable.app/
- **Backend:** https://monad-wallet-checker-production.up.railway.app/
- **Health Check:** https://monad-wallet-checker-production.up.railway.app/health

### Integration Status:
- ✅ **Railway Backend:** Running on port 3001 with health endpoint
- ✅ **Frontend Updated:** Now points directly to Railway URL  
- ✅ **GitHub Deployed:** Changes pushed and will deploy automatically
- ✅ **Public Access:** Both services publicly accessible
- ✅ **No Secrets Needed:** Using public API endpoint (no sensitive keys)

### Test Your Integration:
1. Wait 2-3 minutes for Lovable to redeploy from GitHub
2. Visit: https://mondoctor.lovable.app/
3. Try scanning a wallet address
4. Should now show "Live Monitoring" instead of "Offline Mode"
