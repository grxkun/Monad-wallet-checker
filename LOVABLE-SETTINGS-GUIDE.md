# 🎯 How to Find Settings in Lovable

## Step-by-Step Guide:

### 1. Go to Your Lovable Project
- Visit: https://lovable.dev/projects/7c36db78-9a1d-4c0f-8f35-756d3a186a5b

### 2. Look for Settings Location
The Settings can typically be found in one of these locations:

#### Option A: Top Navigation Bar
- Look for a **gear icon (⚙️)** or **"Settings"** text in the top navigation
- Usually located in the top-right corner of the screen

#### Option B: Left Sidebar Menu
- Check the left sidebar for a **"Settings"** or **"Project Settings"** option
- Often represented with a gear icon

#### Option C: Project Menu
- Look for a **three-dot menu (⋯)** or **hamburger menu (☰)**
- Click it to reveal dropdown options including "Settings"

#### Option D: Environment Variables Direct
- Some Lovable interfaces have **"Environment Variables"** or **"Env Vars"** directly visible
- Look for tabs like: "Code" | "Preview" | **"Environment"** | "Deploy"

### 3. What to Look For:
Once in Settings, find:
- **Environment Variables** section
- **Project Configuration** 
- **Deployment Settings**
- **Build Settings**

### 4. Add Your Environment Variable:
```
Variable Name: VITE_API_URL
Variable Value: https://monad-wallet-checker-production.up.railway.app
```

## Visual Hints:
- 🔍 Look for: ⚙️ Settings, 🌍 Environment, 🔧 Config icons
- 📱 On mobile: May be in a collapsed menu
- 💻 On desktop: Usually top-right or left sidebar

## Alternative Method:
If you can't find Settings, try:
1. Right-click anywhere on the project page
2. Look for "Project Settings" in context menu
3. Or check the URL bar - sometimes adding `/settings` to the URL works
